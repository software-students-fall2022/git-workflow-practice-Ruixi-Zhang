* I would like to share this interesting website/gitlab repo that contains a collection of software engineering internship
opportunities that was organized by contributors. I believe that this is very helpful for everyone who is looking for 
a software engineering job (which I believe is everyone in this class).

* Ian's comment: I think this website is super helpful! Thank you Ruixi for sharing! I will check it out.
